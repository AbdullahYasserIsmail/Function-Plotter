Welcome to the "Function Plotter" project. 

The function of project is to plot user-entered mathematical expressions and plot its graph. The expression must be in terms of x (lowercase). It can be writting in form of "y = .......".

All what you have to do is just enter a mathematical expression and this program will process this expression and plot it if possible. 

The program was basically built using PySide2 and matplotlibrary. PySide2 were utilized to create a smooth GUI for the program in order to make it easily usable. 

The GUI window that is launched is clean, simply and tells what to do based on your interactions.

I have also taken advantage of the a powerful capabilities of matplotlib to finish this program and incorporate the basic function of the program: graphing. 

Why to use this program?

1- It's smart as it can understand a lot of expressions and handle them to produce a graph.

2- It can detect errors and tell you which kind of error in the mathematical expression of yours, which makes it a lot easier to correct it.

3- It's flexible and can do more better than that. The program can plot expnonetial, log10, square root, polynomial, and constant functions. However, with just two steps
you can extend its functionality and add more functions to be plotted.

4- The GUI is simple and clean.

To run this project, all what you have to do is just download the main.py file and run it. Before doing so, please run it on an IDE like pycharm and make sure you have the following modules installed:

1-Numpy

2-Matplotlib

3-PySide2

4-Pytest (for automated tests)

5-Pytest-qt

Please don't run it on environments like google colab as they are not suitable for such kind of programs. I already did this and the program crashed.
The program also has two python files for automated tests and making sure the program is totally functional. I already included a lot of test cases
that check for the program functionality and correctness.
